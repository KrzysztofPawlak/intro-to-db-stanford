Q1
Write a trigger that makes new students named 'Friendly' automatically like everyone else in their grade. That is, after the trigger runs, we should have ('Friendly', A) in the Likes table for every other Highschooler A in the same grade as 'Friendly'. 

CREATE TRIGGER Friendly 
AFTER INSERT ON Highschooler
WHEN New.name = 'Friendly'
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Likes SELECT New.id, h.id FROM Highschooler AS h WHERE New.grade = h.grade AND h.id != New.id;
END;

Q2
Write one or more triggers to manage the grade attribute of new Highschoolers. If the inserted tuple has a value less than 9 or greater than 12, change the value to NULL. On the other hand, if the inserted tuple has a null value for grade, change it to 9. 

CREATE TRIGGER GRADE 
AFTER INSERT ON Highschooler
WHEN New.grade IS NULL OR New.grade < 9 OR New.grade > 12
BEGIN
    UPDATE Highschooler SET grade = 9 WHERE New.id = id AND New.grade IS NULL;
    UPDATE Highschooler SET grade = NULL WHERE New.id = id AND (New.grade < 9 OR New.grade > 12);
END;

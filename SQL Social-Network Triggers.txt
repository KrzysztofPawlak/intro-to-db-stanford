Q1
Write a trigger that makes new students named 'Friendly' automatically like everyone else in their grade. That is, after the trigger runs, we should have ('Friendly', A) in the Likes table for every other Highschooler A in the same grade as 'Friendly'. 

CREATE TRIGGER Friendly 
AFTER INSERT ON Highschooler
WHEN New.name = 'Friendly'
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Likes SELECT New.id, h.id FROM Highschooler AS h WHERE New.grade = h.grade AND h.id != New.id;
END;

Q1 Write an instead-of trigger that enables updates to the title attribute of view LateRating. 

Policy: Updates to attribute title in LateRating should update Movie.title for the corresponding movie. (You may assume attribute mID is a key for table Movie.) Make sure the mID attribute of view LateRating has not also been updated -- if it has been updated, don't make any changes. Don't worry about updates to stars or ratingDate. 

CREATE TRIGGER movieUpdate
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON LateRating
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE Movie
    SET title = New.title
    WHERE mID = New.mID;
END;

Q2 Write an instead-of trigger that enables updates to the stars attribute of view LateRating. 

Policy: Updates to attribute stars in LateRating should update Rating.stars for the corresponding movie rating. (You may assume attributes [mID,ratingDate] together are a key for table Rating.) Make sure the mID and ratingDate attributes of view LateRating have not also been updated -- if either one has been updated, don't make any changes. Don't worry about updates to title. 

CREATE TRIGGER movieUpdateStars
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON LateRating
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE Rating
    SET stars = New.stars
    WHERE mID = New.mID
	AND ratingDate = New.ratingDate;
END;

Q3 Write an instead-of trigger that enables updates to the mID attribute of view LateRating. 

Policy: Updates to attribute mID in LateRating should update Movie.mID and Rating.mID for the corresponding movie. Update all Rating tuples with the old mID, not just the ones contributing to the view. Don't worry about updates to title, stars, or ratingDate. 

CREATE TRIGGER movieUpdateId
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON LateRating
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE Movie
    SET mID = New.mID
    WHERE mID = Old.mID;
    UPDATE Rating
    SET mID = New.mID
    WHERE mID = Old.mID;
END;

Q4 Write an instead-of trigger that enables deletions from view HighlyRated. 

Policy: Deletions from view HighlyRated should delete all ratings for the corresponding movie that have stars > 3. 

CREATE TRIGGER highlyRatedDelete
INSTEAD OF DELETE ON HighlyRated
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM Rating
    WHERE mID = Old.mID 
    AND stars > 3;
END;

Q5 Write an instead-of trigger that enables deletions from view HighlyRated

Policy: Deletions from view HighlyRated should update all ratings for the corresponding movie that have stars > 3 so they have stars = 3. 

CREATE TRIGGER highlyRatedDelete
INSTEAD OF DELETE ON HighlyRated
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE Rating
    SET stars = 3
    WHERE mID = Old.mID
    AND stars > 3;
END;

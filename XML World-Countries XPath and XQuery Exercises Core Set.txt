Q3
Return the average population of Russian-speaking countries. 

avg(doc("countries.xml")/countries/country[language = 'Russian']/data(@population))

Q4
Return the names of all countries where over 50% of the population speaks German. (Hint: Depending on your solution, you may want to use ".", which refers to the "current element" within an XPath expression.) 

doc("countries.xml")/countries/country[language[data(.) = 'German' and @percentage > 50]]/data(@name)


Q5
Return the name of the country with the highest population. (Hint: You may need to explicitly cast population numbers as integers with xs:int() to get the correct answer.) 

doc("countries.xml")/countries/country[xs:int(@population) = max(doc("countries.xml")/countries/country/xs:int(@population))]/data(@name)

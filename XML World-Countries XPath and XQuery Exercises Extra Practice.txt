Q1
Return the names of all countries with population greater than 100 million. 

doc("countries.xml")//country[@population > 100000000]/data(@name)

Q2
Return the names of all countries where a city in that country contains more than one-third of the country's population. 

doc("countries.xml")//country[city/population > @population div 3]/data(@name)

Q3
Return the population density of Qatar. Note: Since the "/" operator has its own meaning in XPath and XQuery, the division operator is "div". To compute population density use "(@population div @area)". 

doc("countries.xml")//country[data(@name) = 'Qatar']/data(@population div @area)

Q4
Return the names of all countries whose population is less than one thousandth that of some city (in any country). 

doc("countries.xml")//country[@population < //city/(population div 1000)]/data(@name)

Q5
Return all city names that appear more than once, i.e., there is more than one city with that name in the data. Return only one instance of each such city name. (Hint: You might want to use the "preceding" and/or "following" navigation axes for this query, which were not covered in the video or our demo script; they match any preceding or following node, not just siblings.) 

doc("countries.xml")//country/city[name = following::name]/name

Q6
Return the names of all countries containing a city such that some other country has a city of the same name. (Hint: You might want to use the "preceding" and/or "following" navigation axes for this query, which were not covered in the video or our demo script; they match any preceding or following node, not just siblings.) 

doc("countries.xml")//country[city/name = following::city/name or city/name = preceding::city/name]/data(@name)
